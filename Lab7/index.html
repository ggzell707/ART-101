					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we had to create a function. We created one based on the example on canvas that retreives user input and outputs a line of text followed by the user input sorted alphabetically.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My partner and I had a hard time reaching our desired output, mostly due to spelling errors. The tasks made me realize that when practicing JavaScript, it is very important to go back and check that everything is written properly. It's crucial to pay attention to small details like capitalization or punctuation when writing code, as even minor errors can cause the code to fail. To solve this issue, we would check each other's work afterward to look for errors when our code would not run. We also offered each other feedback and advice, such as organizing our files properly or suggesting memorization tips.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This activity made me more aware of having to type properly to successfully run my program. It also made me realize that the more I dive into the coding world, the more I will have to debug. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>

						 In the end, we managed to print out our desired function. The results are down below.</p>
