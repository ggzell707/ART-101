			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>With a partner, we worked to create local file structures, create new html.index files, connect files
						to each other, and upload them to github. It was a fun learning experience that made us realize the importance
						of organizing files appropriately and got us to practice referencing content.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Problems arose when trying to connect the index.html file with the img file. This challenge was 
						surpassed during the lecture when we learned more about how we could connect files using the "link" feature.
					</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> The transiiton from lab 2 to lab 3 was a bit tough to manage since I was surprised by the time crunch. 
						This along with the constant power outages made it a bit hard to manage. Overall however, I think
					that we put a lot of effort into this project and I am really proud of how it turned out.  </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The transition from lab 2 to lab 3 was a bit tough to manage since I was surprised by the time crunch. 
						Additionally, the frequent power outages made it even more difficult to manage. Despite these obstacles, 
						I believe that we put in a lot of effort into this project, and I am extremely proud of the end result.</p>
