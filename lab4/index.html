			<h1>Lab X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this project, we had to figure out how to write pseudocode. We started off by writing down task ideas and chose one to break down into smaller steps (emailing a professor). We then had to write steps for a simple computer game. We later formatted this into pseudocode for javascript.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had a bit of trouble understanding what the assignment was asking us to do since the instructions were brief. We ended up doing what we felt it was most asking us to do and used resources, such as google, to figure out how to complete the tasks at hand. We also had trouble formatting the pseudocode and found that you use the tab key to create the indents for the sub-steps. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> We put a lot of effort into breaking down what the assignment was asking us to do. We also discussed the importance of dismantling the steps and tried to be as specific as possible. Our pseudocode ended up being properly formatted and we broke down the steps to be as precise as possible (as though we were actually coding for the game). </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Ultimately, we have a good outline for peudocode comments for the online snake game. We also now have a better understanding on pseudocoding and how to break up the steps to make them more organized.</p>
