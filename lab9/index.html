			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries and Jquery </h1>

            <div id= "challenge" class= "minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p> For this lab, we had to create three buttons for our sections by connecting the Javascript to CSS and HTML using Jquery.</p>
                    <button id="button-challenge">click me</button>
			</div>

            <div id= "problems" class= "minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p> We came across a couple of problems when completing this assignment. The instructions were a bit unclear about what elements go into which folder, 
                    so we had to figure that out through trial and error. </p>
                <button id="button-problems"> click me again! </button>
            </div>

            <div id= "results" class= "minor-section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p> We ended up creating three buttons, each one at the bottom of every section. Upon clicking, the minor section box changes in color. This was possible through using Jquery.</p>
                <button id="button-results"> Click me one more time!!!</button>
            </div>
