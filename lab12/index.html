            <div id= "challenge" class= "minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>The challenge of this project was to use conditionals to create a input text box that outputs a specific output based on the characters of the input. </p>
			</div>

            <div id= "problems" class= "minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p> One problem we faced was that the output would not show up upon request. We realized that it was because the HTML and Javascript files were not properly linked to each other. To solve this issue, we used chatGPT to write the label for the input so that way it would show up when we opened the website. </p>.  </p>
            </div>

            <div id= "results" class= "minor-section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The results are down below. It is a textbox in which you can write your name, and click submit, and it will print out the beginning of a sentence and a different result at the end based on the characters of the input.</p>
