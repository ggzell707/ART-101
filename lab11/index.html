            <div id= "challenge" class= "minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>The challenge of this project was to create events and forms using Javascript. </p>
			</div>

            <div id= "problems" class= "minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>We came across problems when it came to wanting our button to continue randomizing the input word just by reclicking the "submit"button. We used ChatGpt and asked help from a friend majoring in computer science to be able to do this.  </p>
            </div>

            <div id= "results" class= "minor-section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The results are below. It is a box in which you can input words and upon clicking the "submit" button, it randomizes the word above. If you keep clicking, it will keep randomizing the characters. The type box displays "input your name" so the user could type in their name and see how it randomizes above. Like in the previous project, we connected it to css for display purposes. </p>
