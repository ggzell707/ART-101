					<h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p> The challenge of this lab was to practice using Anonymous functions and Callbacks. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p> We came across some issues in terms of printing out the results. We kept going back and forth between the isntructions, the linked resource in the module section, and using google as a resource to figure out how to print out our results in the console. Many of our issues were rooted in naming our variables properly.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p> I thought I had a good grip on the topics practiced in the last 3 labs. Turns out remembering them is a bit harder than what I had originally thought. Combining the topics was also difficult to understand.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Upon opening our page and popping up the console, you will be able to see our results printed out. </p>
